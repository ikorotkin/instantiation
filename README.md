# Instantiation of a scene in GDScript

This example demonstrates two different approaches to creating a scene instance from a script in **Godot 4**. Here we create two simple independent scenes: scene `Main` with a simple label and scene `Icon` with a small image. Then we programmatically create multiple instances of the `Icon` scene in `Main` using a simple script.

The `Icon` scene will be instantiated after each mouse click. Here is the application window after 21 clicks showing the total number of icons:
